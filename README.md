# Regression Analysis: MLB Pitch Velocity and xERA

This project investigates how a Major League Baseball pitcherâ€™s **fastball velocity (FBv)** and **pitch location (Location+)** relate to their **expected ERA (xERA)** using multiple linear regression.

## ðŸ“Š Objectives
- Explore whether faster fastballs are associated with better pitching performance.
- Test how pitch location influences expected run prevention.
- Identify and remove high-influence points to improve model accuracy.

## ðŸ§® Methods
- Used **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** regression via `statsmodels`
- Detected high-influence data using **Cookâ€™s Distance**
- Evaluated model with **RÂ²**, **Adjusted RÂ²**, **AIC**, and **BIC**

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| RÂ² | 0.209 |
| Adjusted RÂ² | 0.175 |
| Significant Predictor | Fastball Velocity (p = 0.004) |
| Non-Significant Predictor | Location+ (p = 0.116) |

## ðŸ’¡ Interpretation
Faster fastball velocity correlates with lower expected ERA, suggesting velocity plays a measurable role in pitcher effectiveness. Pitch location contributes positively but less significantly.

## ðŸ§° Tools
- Python, pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scikit-learn, matplotlib
